# [Together AI](https://together.xyz)

Together is an AI company that develops large language models (LLMs). It provides various platforms and models, such as OpenChatKit, RedPajama, and GPT-JT, to empower developers and researchers in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Together's focus is on open-source AI research and infrastructure, enabling collaboration and innovation in the rapidly growing AI landscape.

## Interface Name

- `togetherai`

### Example Usage

```javascript
const { LLMInterface } = require('large-models-interface');

LLMInterface.setApiKey({'togetherai': process.env.TOGETHERAI_API_KEY});

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await LLMInterface.sendMessage('togetherai', 'Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.');
    console.log(response.results);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw error;
  }
}

main();
```

### Model Aliases

The following model aliases are provided for this provider. 

- `default`: google/gemma-7b
- `large`: mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B
- `small`: google/gemma-2b
- `agent`: Qwen/Qwen1.5-14B

### Embeddings Model Aliases

- `default`: bert-base-uncased
- `large`: BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
- `small`: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 


## Options

The following parameters can be passed through `options`.

- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
- `response_format`: Defines the format of the AI's response. Setting this to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, ensuring the message generated by the model is valid JSON.
- `stream`: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, similar to ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the AI's responses. A higher temperature results in more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes the output more focused and deterministic. Generally, it is recommended to alter this or top_p, but not both.
- `tool_choice`: Specifies which external tools the AI can use to assist in generating its response.
- `tools`: A list of external tools available for the AI to use in generating responses.


### Features

- Native JSON Mode
- Streaming
- Tools
- Embeddings
