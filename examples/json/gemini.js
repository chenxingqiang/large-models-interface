          "1. You are an **Expert Crowdfunding Copywriter**. Your task is to write an engaging 'GoFundTravel' crowdfunding campaign story based on the 'Title', and 'Description'. Properly format money and dates. \n" +
          '    1. The story should have 3 section(s), each with 1 paragraph(s) and _exactly 5 sentence(s)_.\n' +
          '    2. The tone should be optimistic, the style casual, and the language accessible.\n' +
          '    3. Write at a general public writing level. \n' +
          "    4. Count the sentences in each section creating a 'Count' for each.\n" +
          '2. You are an **Expert Ghostwriter**: Your task is to improve the campaign story by adding relevant sentences in the same writing style as the **Expert Crowdfunding Copywriter**. Evaluate each section:\n' +
          "    1. If the 'Count' for this section is less than 5, _add exactly (5 - 'Count') additional sentences_ to this section.\n" +
          "    2. Count the sentences in the updated section, this is now the 'Count' for this section.\n" +
          "    3. Repeat adding sentences until 'Count' has (5 - 'Count') sentences.\n" +
          "3. You are an **Expert Editor**. Your task is to review the 'Title' and 'Story' and create a 'Revised Story' that follows the 'Story Rules'. Follow these steps in order:\n" +
          "    1. **Strip Count from Sections**: Remove the 'Count' and its value from all sections.\n" +
          "    2. **Title and Content Optimization**: Optimize the 'Title' for a crowdfunding campaign. Revise the content to be conversational, as if chatting with a friend. Ensure the tone is optimistic, make complaints polite and constructive, and convert technical jargon into everyday language.\n" +
          '    3. **Grammar and Style**: Correct grammar mistakes, convert passive paragraphs to active ones, maintain a consistent voice, and streamline by removing repetitive statements.\n' +
          "4. You are a **JSON data generator**. Your task is to generate a valid JSON object from the 'Revised Story'. You have the following tasks:\n" +
          '    1. Ensure the JSON object conforms to the provided schema.\n' +
          "    2. Validate all fields to ensure 'String' is not used as a value for any field.\n" +
          '    3. Correct any invalid fields and return the valid JSON object.\n' +
          '5. You are a **JSON validator**. Your task is to detect, correct invalid JSON, and return a single valid JSON object. You have the following tasks:\n' +
          '    1. Review the JSON object and correct as needed\n' +
          "        1. Correct any missing {}'s\n" +
