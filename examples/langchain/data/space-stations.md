**Space Stations: Humanity's Outposts in Orbit**

Space stations serve as vital platforms for scientific research, technological development, and international collaboration in space. They offer unique environments for studying the effects of microgravity, observing Earth, and preparing for future deep-space missions.

**Current and Past Space Stations**

* **International Space Station (ISS):** A collaborative project involving five space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA), the ISS is a continuously inhabited research laboratory orbiting Earth since 2000.
* **Tiangong Space Station:** China's Tiangong is a modular space station currently under construction, with plans for completion in 2022. It will serve as a national space laboratory and a platform for future missions.
* **Mir:**  A Soviet/Russian space station operated from 1986 to 2001, Mir held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space until it was surpassed by the ISS.
* **Skylab:** The first American space station, Skylab operated from 1973 to 1979, hosting three crews and conducting valuable research on solar astronomy and microgravity effects.
* **Salyut:** A series of Soviet space stations launched between 1971 and 1986, Salyut provided valuable experience in long-duration spaceflight and scientific research.

**Key Roles of Space Stations**

* **Scientific Research:** Space stations host experiments in various fields, including biology, physics, materials science, and astronomy. Microgravity environments allow for unique research opportunities not possible on Earth.
* **Technological Development:**  New technologies for life support, propulsion, and space manufacturing are tested and developed on space stations, paving the way for future space exploration.
* **Earth Observation:** Instruments on space stations monitor Earth's climate, weather patterns, and environmental changes, providing valuable data for scientific research and policymaking.
* **Preparation for Deep-Space Missions:** Space stations serve as training grounds for astronauts preparing for long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
