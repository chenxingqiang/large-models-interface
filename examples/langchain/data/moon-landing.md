**Apollo Missions and the Moon Landings**

The Apollo program, a monumental endeavor by NASA, led to the historic first human landing on the Moon in 1969. This achievement marked a turning point in space exploration and captured the world's imagination.  Let's delve into the details of the Moon landings, from the first steps to the scientific discoveries that followed.

**The First Person on the Moon**

On July 20, 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong etched his name in history as the first person to set foot on the Moon. This iconic moment, during the Apollo 11 mission, was broadcast live to a captivated global audience.
